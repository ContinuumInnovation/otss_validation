usage() {
    cat <<EOF
$0 [ options ]

Automates the build process using cmake and make.

By default, the build process will clear the "build" folder,
then "make all" in DEBUG mode with 4 threads.

Options:
    (--clean | -c)
        Forces the cleaning of the "build" folder.

    (--num-threads | -j) [ value ]
        Overrides the number of threads used by make (default: 4).

    (--release | -r)
        Runs a RELEASE version of the build process.

    (--target | -t) [ target ]
        Determines the make target (default: all).

Examples:
    > $0 -c -r -t hotsprings

        Perform a release build of the hotsprings target and cleaning the
        "build" folder first.

    > $0 -c -j 1

        Perform a full build while cleaning the "build" folder first,
        and uses make with only 1 thread.
